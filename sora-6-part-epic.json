      "prompt": "@isaiahdupree awakens in an ancient stone temple as mystical energy swirls around them, glowing runes activating across their body. They rise from a sarcophagus, eyes blazing with golden light. Outside, the world burns under a red sky.

Buildings crumble around them as they leap from rooftop to rooftop, dispatching enemies with impossible speed and precision.

      "prompt": "@isaiahdupree lies broken in a crater, rain pouring down. Memories flash of everyone they're fighting for. Their eyes snap open with renewed determination. Rising slowly, wounds healing with golden light, they transform - armor of pure energy materializing around them, wings of flame spreading from their back. They launch into the sky like a comet, screaming toward the final battle."

The battle is cataclysmic - they trade blows that crack the earth and tear holes in space. In the climax, @isaiahdupree channels all their power into one ultimate strike, plunging their sword through the darkness. Light explodes outward, the sky clears to reveal stars, and they stand victorious as the sun rises on a saved world."
