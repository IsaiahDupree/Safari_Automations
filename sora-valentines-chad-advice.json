      "title": "The Walk-Up",
      "prompt": "@isaiahdupree walks confidently toward the camera in slow motion, wearing a crisp fitted suit, jaw chiseled, smirking knowingly. He stops, adjusts his cufflinks, and speaks directly to camera with text overlay appearing: 'Valentine's Day tip #1: Stop overthinking. She wants your presence, not your presents.' He gestures dismissively at an expensive gift box, then points to his heart. Cinematic lighting, city rooftop at golden hour behind him."

      "prompt": "@isaiahdupree sits backwards on a chair, arms folded across the back, speaking straight to camera with intense eye contact. He's wearing a black turtleneck, silver chain visible. Text overlay appears as he speaks: 'Valentine's Day tip #2: Cook for her. Yeah, YOU cook. Doesn't have to be good - has to be effort.' He stands up confidently, gestures like he's dropping a mic, winks at camera. Moody studio lighting, smoke wisps in background."

      "prompt": "@isaiahdupree leans against a luxury car at night, city lights reflecting, arms crossed, looking unbothered. He speaks to camera with swagger, text overlay: 'Valentine's Day tip #3: Write her a letter. By hand. Yes, with a pen. Tell her what you actually feel.' He pulls out a handwritten letter, taps it against his palm meaningfully. 'That's the move.' He walks off screen confidently. Cinematic noir lighting, rain-slicked streets."

      "title": "The Truth Bomb",
      "prompt": "@isaiahdupree stands in an elevator, doors closing, speaking directly to camera like he's dropping wisdom on a stranger. Wearing a leather jacket over a henley. Text overlay: 'Valentine's Day tip #4: Put. The. Phone. Down. Look her in the eyes when she talks. Actually listen.' He taps his temple knowingly. 'That's the real gift.' Elevator dings, doors open to reveal city skyline. He nods at camera and walks out with purpose."

      "prompt": "@isaiahdupree sits on the edge of a rooftop at sunset, city sprawling behind him, speaking intimately to camera. Fitted white shirt, sleeves rolled up, chain glinting. Text overlay: 'Valentine's Day tip #5: Don't wait for February 14th. Love her loud every single day.' He stands, adjusts his collar, looks at the sunset then back at camera with a knowing smile. 'Now you know.' Walks toward the sunset silhouette. Cinematic golden hour lighting."
